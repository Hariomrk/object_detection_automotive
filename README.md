AI-Based Vehicle Following Detection System

Project Aim:
Detect if a vehicle is following another vehicle continuously and generate an alert using AI, tracking, and optional IoT integration.

Project Overview

This project is a real-time vehicle following detection system. Using YOLOv8/YOLOv11 and BYTETracker, we can detect vehicles in traffic videos and track their movement over time. The system identifies if a vehicle is continuously following another vehicle and can raise alerts.
